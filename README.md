# FairSoft

The FairSoft distribution provides the software packages needed to compile and run the [FairRoot framework](https://github.com/FairRootGroup/FairRoot) and experiment packages based on FairRoot. FairSoft is a source distribution with recurring releases for macOS and Linux.

## [Spack based](docs/README.md) (EXPERIMENTAL) or [Legacy](legacy/README.md) installation

This release features both, a classic (called "Legacy") installation method, and a new spack based one.

* **Spack based**: This is to be considered EXPERIMENTAL. It is still being developed. There are no guarantees for stability of workflows/etc. Most things are already working, but there are a bunch of issues. Spack itself is also still in heavy development. If you're interested in this new system, please continue [here](docs/README.md), and consider getting in contact with the maintainers.

* **Legacy**: This is the known, and proven shell based setup system. Please continue [here](legacy/README.md).
