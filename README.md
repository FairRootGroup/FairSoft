# FairSoft

The FairSoft distribution provides the software packages needed to compile and run the [FairRoot framework](https://github.com/FairRootGroup/FairRoot) and experiment packages based on FairRoot. FairSoft is a source distribution with recurring releases for macOS and Linux.

The newly released FairSoft modernizes and reorganizes the framework installation.
All needed packages, including the FairRoot package itself,
are now installed using [Spack](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The packages are installed by Spack automatically using package [recipes](https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_packaging.html), stored in the corresponding folders of the [packages](./packages) directory. The [recipe](https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_packaging.html)
lists the dependencies of the given package and describes its installation procedure. A collection of packages that form the software framework is called [spack environment](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments.html)  - examples of such are located in the [env](./env) directories.

In the process of installing of a package, Spack creates its list of dependencies,
forming the so-called installation tree. It is possible to install different packages/versions with [Spack](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Since they share a common installation tree, the Spack reuses already available software when installing new package.

---

## I. Preparation

### I.1. Install the [prerequisites](docs/prerequisites.md).

### I.2. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/FairRootGroup/FairSoft
cd FairSoft
git submodule update --init
```

Remember to run `git submodule update --init` even after you checked out a new branch or tag in an existing repository clone!

## II. Configuration

### II.1. Activate Spack in your current shell

```
source thisfairsoft.sh
```

Verify that the `spack` command works and lists the correct FairSoft package [repository](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/repositories.html).

```
$ spack repo list
==> 1 package repository.
fairsoft              ~/FairSoft/repos/fairsoft
fairsoft_backports    ~/FairSoft/repos/fairsoft-backports
builtin               ~/FairSoft/spack/var/spack/repos/builtin
```

### II.2. Configure Spack directories

We recommend to create a [per-user configuration file](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_yaml.html#config-yaml) and point certain paths to a directory outside of the FairSoft source repo because these directories can grow quite large:

```
$ mkdir -p $HOME/.spack
$ EDITOR=vim spack config edit config
$ cat $HOME/.spack/config.yaml
config:
  install_tree: ~/.spack/install_tree
  source_cache: ~/.spack/source_cache
```

The source_cache directory is used by Spack to store the downloaded packages,
while the install_tree holds the whole installation tree.

Verify the config changes are recognized by running `spack config blame config`.

## III. Installation

### III.1. Define a [spack environment](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments.html) for a FairSoft release

```
spack env create jun19 env/jun19/sim_threads.yaml
```

`jun19` can be any name you choose. Verify

```
$ spack env list
==> 1 environments
    jun19
```

### III.2. Activate the Spack environment

In order to work with the previously defined environment, it needs to be activated in any given shell instance

```
spack env activate jun19
```

Verify

```
$ spack env status
==> In environment jun19
```

You may also activate an environment with `-p` which generates a prefix to your prompt as long as the environment is active

```
$ spack env activate -p jun19
[jun19] $
```

To deactive the active environment, run
```
spack env deactivate
```
or
```
despacktivate
```

### III.3. Compile and install the packages defined in the active [spack environment](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments.html)

Inspect the active environment

```
$ spack env activate -p jun19
[jun19] $ spack find
==> In environment jun19
==> Root specs

cmake@3.13.4
dds@2.4

root@6.16.00 +fortran+gdml+http+memstat+pythia6+pythia8~python~tmva+vc~vdt
vgm@4-5

==> 0 installed packages
```

The `jun19` FairSoft release pins certain package version and build variants that have been carefully chosen to work well together. To install the packages in the environment run

```
[jun19] $ spack -C ./config install
```

This step usually takes a while - time for a coffee break â˜•.

### III.4. Verify the installation

## IV. Execution

### IV.1. Spack view

Symbolic links to packages in install tree can be placed to a common installation prefix using view command.
This will create a directory, which can be used as SIMPATH or FAIRROOTPATH in order to build experiment-specific frameworks.
View is created by following command:

Linux
```
[jun19] $ spack -C ./config view --verbose --dependencies true symlink -i (YOUR_SIMPATH) fairroot
```

macOS
```
[jun19] $ spack -C ./config view --verbose --dependencies true -e libpng -e libjpeg-turbo -e libiconv -e sqlite symlink -i (YOUR_SIMPATH) fairroot
```

The view creation has to be done within an [activated environment](#iii2-activate-the-spack-environment).

### IV.2. Spack load

As an alternative to the view the Spack offers the [module mechanism](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module_file_support.html), allowing the user to set the running environment using the load command:

```
[jun19] $ spack load --dependencies fairroot
```

This will set the corrects paths to run the environment.

__This functionally is not yet fully supported.__

## V. Development build

A package can be built in development mode - without checking it out from repository. In this case the code will be taken from local directory SOURCE_PATH.
Following command will run development build of FairRoot with dependencies equivalent to jun19 environemnt on macOS. Currently this has to be configured manually.

```
spack -C ./config dev-build -j JOBS -d SOURCE_PATH fairroot@18.2.1+sim+examples ^pcre+jit ^python@2.7.16 ^py-numpy@1.16.5 ^googletest@1.8.1 ^boost@1.68.0 ^fairlogger@1.4.0 \

```

## VI. [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md)

## Structure of this repo

Releases are defined as a Spack environment in the directory [`env/<release>/<variant>.yaml`](env/).

`repo.yaml` + `packages/` constitute the FairSoft Spack package repository.

`config/` contains some general configuration changes needed on some systems, please use it with `spack -C ./config ...`.

`spack/` is a git submodule which references the Spack git repo which currently contains both the Spack software and the Spack builtin package repository. Because some of the packages a FairSoft release pins down come from the Spack builtin repository, the idea is to pin it, too, to provide a reproducible build experience which does not depend on the various possible combination of Spack and FairSoft. The referenced submodule might also contain some extra patches, that we were not yet able to integrate into the upstream Spack itself.

`docs/` contains additional documentation pages, the relevant ones for the user should all be linked from this top-level page.

`legacy/` contains the former shell script based FairSoft before we switched to Spack, it is no longer updated, but remains for reference.

`test/` contains mainly integration test related files used by the FairSoft Continuous Integration checks. The normal user can ignore them.

CMake/CTest-related files are mainly for internal use and running the FairSoft Continuous Integration checks. The normal user can ignore them.
