## Installation method

Choose between the classic (called "Legacy") installation method or the new Spack-based one:

|  **[Legacy](legacy/README.md)** | **[Spack](docs/README.md) (EXPERIMENTAL)** |
| -- | -- |
| This is the homegrown bash/cmake based setup system. | This is an ongoing standardization and modernization effort based on Spack (which itself is still under heavy development). Most things are already working. For early adopters. |
