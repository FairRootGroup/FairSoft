## Preface

Our classic bash/cmake based setup system
has been named "Legacy". It has been moved to the
sub-directory `legacy/` to distinguish it clearly
from the future Spack-based setup system
(for more information see [here](../docs/README.md)).
The latter will eventually replace the "Legacy" setup system
in a future release.

## Installation from source

Installing FairSoft is based on the standard CMake workflow.

### 1. Install system dependencies

Find the list of required system packages together with instructions
on how to install them in the [dependencies section](dependencies.md).

### 2. Clone the git repo

```
git clone -b <release> https://github.com/FairRootGroup/FairSoft
```

For `<release>` choose
* `jan24`, or `nov22p1`, ... - a particular release
* `jan24_patches` - always points to the latest patch release for the `nov22` release
* `master` - track the latest stable release (e.g. if `jan24` is the latest release `master` is the same as `jan24_patches`)
* `dev` - the bleeding edge development version

Discover releases here: https://github.com/FairRootGroup/FairSoft/releases

### 3. CMake configure step

```
cmake -S <path-to-source> -B <path-to-build> -C <path-to-source>/FairSoftConfig.cmake
```

* `<path-to-source>` shall point to the cloned git repo from the previous step
* `<path-to-build>` is a temporary directory of your choice where all of the package download, extraction, and building happens

Set the installation prefix and more customization options in the [`FairSoftConfig.cmake`](../FairSoftConfig.cmake) file itself.

**macOS users**: Notice [macOS SDK](advanced.md#macos-sdk)!

### 4. CMake build/install step

After a successful CMake configure step, you start the build/install step as follows:

```
cmake --build <path-to-build> [-j<ncpus>]
```

* `<path-to-build>` is the same directory as chosen in the previous configure step
* `-j<ncpus>` parallelize the build

### 5. Usage

```
export SIMPATH=<path-to-install>
```

Simply export an environment variable `SIMPATH` which points to the chosen install directory from step 2
and continue with the [FairRoot installation](https://github.com/FairRootGroup/FairRoot).
