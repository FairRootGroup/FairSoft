# Advanced Installation Guide

This guide assumes that the user is somewhat familiar with Spack. See the [Spack documentation](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) if you want to learn more about Spack.

## Configure Spack directories

Over time, the install tree and source cache of Spack may grow quite large (multiple Gigabytes). With the following commands it is possible to specify locations outside of the FairSoft git repo:

```
$ spack config --scope site add config:install_tree:/path/of/your/choice
$ spack config --scope site add config:source_cache:/path/of/your/choice2
```

Verify your settings:

```
$ spack config blame config | grep -e source_cache -e install_tree
~/FairSoft/spack/etc/spack/defaults/config.yaml:23     install_tree: /path/of/your/choice
~/FairSoft/spack/etc/spack/defaults/config.yaml:118    source_cache: /path/of/your/choice2
```

Re-location of an already existing install tree is not supported.

## Setup your Spack environment

Next add Spack to your path. Spack has some nice command line integration tools,
so instead of simply appending to your PATH variable, source the spack setup script.
This also adds Spack to your path.

```bash
cd (Choose-dir)
source spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
```

## Add FairSoft repository to spack
```bash
spack repo add PATH-TO-FAIRSOFT-SPACK
```

Depending on your use case, you may want to provide configuration settings common to everyone on your team,
or you may want to set default behaviors specific to a single user account.
Spack provides six configuration scopes to handle this customization.
These scopes, in order of decreasing priority, are:


| Scope        | Directory |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Command-line | N/A       |
| Custom       | Custom directory, specified with --config-scope |
| User         | ~/.spack/ |
| Site         | $SPACK_ROOT/etc/spack/ |
| System       | /etc/spack/ |
| Defaults     | $SPACK_ROOT/etc/spack/defaults/ |


Spack allows customization of several high-level settings.
These settings are stored in the generic config.yaml configuration file.
You can see the default settings by running:

```bash
spack config --scope defaults edit config
```

which opens the file $SPACK_ROOT/etc/spack/defaults/config.yaml. Either change the default settings
or copy the file

```bash
cp $SPACK_ROOT/etc/spack/defaults/config.yaml ~/.spack/
```

to your user scope.

The default configuration defines the installtion directory to be
$SPACK_ROOT/opt/spack. Since this will do the installation into the local working copy
we recommend to change the installation directory.

A full description of all the various configuration options can be found
in the [Spack documentation.](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_configuration.html)

## Use system packages

Sometimes it could also be necessary that Spack uses externally installed packages.
For example this is a solution if a package can't be build on a system.
Package preferences in Spack are managed through the packages.yaml configuration file.
First, we will look at the default packages.yaml file.

```bash
spack config --scope defaults edit packages
```

Either change the default settings or copy the file

```bash
cp $SPACK_ROOT/etc/spack/defaults/package.yaml ~/.spack/
```

to your user scope. A full description of all the package options can be found
in the [Spack documentation.](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_configuration.html#external-packages)

This settings in the file define the default preferences for compilers and
for providers of virtual packages. There are no externally installed packages
defined yet. To define these you need a description like the following to the file


```bash
zlib:
    paths:
      zlib@1.2.8%gcc@5.4.0 arch=linux-ubuntu16.04-x86_64: /usr
```

Here zlib is the name of the package which should be taken from the system.
zlib@1.2.8%gcc@5.4.0 is the complete description of the package to be used from an
external location, which is version 1.2.8 of zlib compiled with gcc at version 5.4.0.
arch=linux-ubuntu16.04-x86_64: describes the system for which this package should be used
which is a 64bit version Ubuntu Linux 16.04. And finally it is described wehere the
installed package is found, in this case it is /usr.

### Use needed system package on macOS 10.12

We encountered compilation problems on macosx 10.12. At least on this system it was impossible to
compile the mesa package which provides the OpenGL support. The problem with python was that
packages which depends on python showed compilation errors which were related to the python
installation. The compilation of python itself worked without problems.

To solve theses issues we add the following lines:

```bash
  mesa:
    paths:
      mesa~llvm@19.0.4%clang@9.0.0-apple arch=darwin-sierra-x86_64: /usr/local/Cellar/mesa/19.0.2
  python:
    paths:
      python+shared@3.7.3%clang@9.0.0-apple arch=darwin-sierra-x86_64: /usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.3
```

## Use existing Spack installation

You can point your Spack installation to another installation to use any packages that are installed there.
A single Spack instance can use multiple upstream Spack installations. Spack will search upstream instances
in the order you list them in your configuration. If your installation refers to instances X and Y,
in that order, then instance X must list Y as an upstream in its own upstreams.yaml.

To register any other Spack instance, you can add it as an entry to upstreams.yaml file.
If the file does not exist yet you have to create it in ~/.spack:

```bash
upstreams:
  spack-instance-1:
    install_tree: /path/to/other/spack/opt/spack
  spack-instance-2:
    install_tree: /path/to/another/spack/opt/spack
```

Once the upstream Spack instance has been added, spack will automatically check the upstream instance when
querying installed packages, and new package installations for the local Spack install will use any
dependencies that are installed in the upstream instance.

A full description of all the upstream options can be found
in the [Spack documentation.](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chain.html)


### Use GSI installation on CVMFS

At GSI there is already a central Spack installation of FairRoot on CVMFS. To use this installation
add the following lines to your upstreams.yaml file:

```bash
upstreams:
  spack-instance-1:
    install_tree: /cvmfs/fairroot.gsi.de/spack
    modules:
      tcl: /cvmfs/fairroot.gsi.de/spack/share/spack/modules
```

The first part tells Spack where to find the installed packages. The second part tells Spack
where to find the generated module files which are needed to setup the proper runtime environment.

After the upstream installation was added ot is necessary to rerun the Spack setup script because
otherwise the installed module files are not found:

```bash
source $SPACK/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
```

Here $SPACK denotes the base directory of your Spack sources.

## Install a package using Spack

After all the previous steps Spack should be used to install FairRoot. This is in the end done rather simple
using the following command:

```bash
spack install fairroot
```

which will install FairRoot and all its dependencies. This will install the version which is defined as default.
If it is intended to install aspecific version this version has to be specified as parameter:

```bash
spack install fairroot@v18.0.6
```

At the time of writing there are three versions available: dev, RC_v18.1.0 and v18.0.6.

To have a look at the complete dependency tree one can use the following command:

```bash
spack spec fairroot
```

or

```bash
spack spec fairroot@v18.0.6
```

to et the information for a specific version.

Since the dependency tree of FairRoot is rather large this step can take quite some time. If you are using an
existing external Spack installation with all needed packages already installed the step only takes some seconds.
In any case the result should be similar to the line below:

```bash
==> fairroot is installed in an upstream Spack instance at /cvmfs/fairroot.gsi.de/spack/linux-debian8-x86_64/gcc-4.9.2/fairroot-18.0.6-rvd5rpdsidvvmuonvj4nacoahigorzic
```

Beside the installation directory which is in the example above /cvmfs/fairroot.gsi.de/spack/ .
Spack adds additional subdirectories for the system (linux-debian8-x86_64) and the compiler (gcc-4.9.2)
which where used to compile the package. The directory for the package contains beside the package name and
version also a unique hash value which depends on the package recipe and some environment.
TODO: Put some more detailed information

After the installation of the FairRoot package the installation directory contains in the order of
100 subdirectories each representing one installed package.

## Setup the correct runtime environment

To properly use the Spack installation of FairRoot on has to setup a runtime environment. Also here
Spack helps to do an easy setup of this runtime environment.

spack view --verbose symlink -i (Choose-dir) fairroot
